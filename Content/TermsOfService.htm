<br>
<br>
<b>PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF SERVICE CAREFULLY. 
THIS AGREEMENT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, DO NOT ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES.</b>

<br>
<br>


By choosing that you agree to the terms of service in your account settings, or by accessing the network, you agree to be bound by these Terms. 
 If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not access or use the Services for any purpose. 
  Please refer to our <a href='PrivacyPolicy.htm'>Privacy Policy</a> for information about how we collect, use and disclose information about you.

<br>
<br>
<b>You and the Company agree as follows:</b>
<br>
<br>


<b>1. Overview of our services:</b>
<br>
<br>
  We provide access to a decentralized, consensus-driven protocol that enables the publication and viewing of information, videos, user posts, data, and other materials (“Content"). 
  Content is distributed via a Federated Environment to our system by Content Publishers and is stored in fragmented files on the STORJ network on thousands of hard drives (called “Hosts") 
 that we subscribe to from the BiblePay sidechain.  Our publishers choose the Title, Description and Data making up the Content. 
<br>
<br>

The Services we provide include an interface for you to access, publish, or host data. The sidechain protocol is not owned, operated, or maintained by us but is an independent blockchain protocol developed by biblepay. 
  We have no responsibility or liability and no ability to control third parties who use our services. We are not able to modify sidechain data, or remove published content
 except in the case where we specifically block content that violates this terms of service.

<br>
<br>

<b>2. Eligibility</b>
<br>
<br>

You must be at least 13 years of age to access or use our Services. 
 If you are under 18 years of age (or the age of legal majority where you live), 
 you may only access or use our Services under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to be bound by these Terms. 
  If you are a parent or legal guardian of a user under the age of 18 (or the age of legal majority), 
 you will be fully responsible for the acts or omissions of such user in connection with our Services. 
  If you are accessing or using our Services on behalf of another person or entity, you represent that you are authorized to accept these Terms on that person or entity’s behalf and that the person or entity agrees to be responsible to 
 us if you or the other person or entity violates these Terms.

<br>
<br>

<b>3. Publishing Content</b>
<br>
<br>


a) You will provide a clear and accurate description of Content you publish, with an accurate representation about the Content. 
  You are solely responsible for resolving any disputes with users who view your Content.
 Publishing data to a blockchain is permanent. We cannot remove published content from the blockchain itself, but we may block it for a legal reason that violates the terms of use.
<br>
<br>

b) The Company is not a party to Users or Publishers with respect to any communications, transactions, interactions, disputes or any relations raised between users and publishers. 
  We will not be responsible for any loss, misuse, or deletion of Content due to its storage, encryption or modification. 
  You are solely responsible for your usage and configuration backups and access.  We are not responsible for any users damages caused by redistribution of Content.

<br>

c) You will not use the Services to deliberately attempt to reserve a Title, Description, or Name that infringes any existing patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other intellectual or proprietary right of any party.

<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>


<b>10. Disclaimers</b>
<br>
<br>

Your use of our Services is at your sole risk. Our Services are provided “as is" and “as available" without warranties of any kind, 
 either express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement. 
 In addition, the Company does not represent or warrant that our Services are accurate, complete, reliable, current or error-free. While the Company attempts to make your access to and use of our Services safe, 
 we cannot and do not represent or warrant that our Services or servers are free of viruses or other harmful components. You assume the entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Services.

<br>
<br>
<b>11. Limitation of Liability</b>
<br>
<br>

The Company and the other Company Parties will not be liable to you under any theory of liability—whether based in contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, warranty, or otherwise—for any indirect, 
 consequential, exemplary, incidental, special or punitive damages or lost profits, even if the Company or the other Company Parties have been advised of the possibility of such damages.

<br>
<br>

The total liability of the Company and the other Company Parties, for any claim arising out of or relating to these Terms or our Services, regardless of the form of the action, 
is limited to the greater of any amount paid, if any, by you to access or use our Services or $100 USD.

<br>
<br>

The limitations set forth in this section will not limit or exclude liability for the gross negligence, fraud or intentional misconduct of the Company or other Company Parties or for any other 
 matters in which liability cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law. Additionally, some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above 
 limitations or exclusions may not apply to you.

<br>
<br>
<b>12. Release</b>
<br>
<br>

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you release the Company and the other Company Parties from responsibility, liability, claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind 
and nature, known and unknown (including, but not limited to, claims of negligence), arising out of or related to disputes between users and the acts or omissions of third parties. 
 You expressly waive any rights you may have under California Civil Code § 1542 as well as any other statute or common law principles that would otherwise limit the coverage of this release to 
 include only those claims which you may know or suspect to exist in your favor at the time of agreeing to this release.

<br>
<br>
<b>13. Dispute Resolution; Arbitration</b>
<br>
<br>

Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with the Company and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us.
<br>
<br>

13.1. Binding Arbitration
<br>
<br>

Except for any disputes, claims, suits, actions, causes of action, demands or proceedings (collectively, “Disputes") in which either party seeks to bring an individual action in small
  claims court or seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, including, without limitation, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents, 
you and the Company (a) waive your and the Company’s respective rights to have any and all Disputes arising from or related to these Terms or the Services resolved in a court, 
 and (b) waive your and the Company’s respective rights to a jury trial. 

<br>

Instead, you and the Company will arbitrate Disputes through binding arbitration (which is the referral of a Dispute to one or more persons charged with reviewing the Dispute and making a final 
 and binding determination to resolve it instead of having the Dispute decided by a judge or jury in court).
<br>
<br>


13.2. No Class Arbitrations, Class Actions or Representative Actions
<br>

<br>

Any Dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or the Services is personal to you and the Company and will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, 
class action or any other type of representative proceeding. There will be no class arbitration or arbitration in which an individual attempts to resolve a Dispute as a representative of 
another individual or group of individuals. Further, a Dispute cannot be brought as a class or other type of representative action, whether within or outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any other individual or group of individuals.
<br>


13.3. Federal Arbitration Act
<br>
<br>

These Terms affect interstate commerce and the enforceability of this Section 16 will be both substantively and procedurally governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act, 
9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (the “FAA"), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.
<br>


13.4. Notice; Informal Dispute Resolution
<br>
<br>

Each party will notify the other party in writing of any arbitrable or small claims Dispute within thirty (30) days of the date it arises, 
so that the parties can attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute informally. Notice to the Company will be sent 
by e-mail to the Company at contact@biblepay.org. 
<br>
 Your notice must include (a) your name, postal address, email address and telephone number, (b) a description in reasonable detail of the nature or basis of the Dispute, 
and (c) the specific relief that you are seeking. If you and the Company cannot agree how to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after the date notice 
 is received by the applicable party, then either you or the Company may, as appropriate and in accordance with this Section 16, commence an arbitration proceeding or, to the extent specifically provided for in Section 17.1, file a claim in court.

<br>
<br>


<b>14. Severability</b>
<br>
<br>

If any term, clause or provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, then that term, clause or provision will be severable from these Terms and will not affect the validity or enforceability of any remaining part of that term, clause or provision, or any other term, clause or provision of these Terms.

<br>
<br>

<b>15. Termination or Suspension</b>
<br>
<br>

Notwithstanding anything contained in these Terms, we reserve the right, without notice and in our sole discretion, to terminate this agreement or suspend your right to access the Services. 
You may terminate this agreement without notice by discontinuing use of the Services. All rights and licenses granted to you under these Terms will immediately 
be revoked upon our termination of the agreement or our suspension of your access to the Services. We make no representations that termination or suspension of the Services will 
prevent the spread or distribution of published Content.

<br>
<br>

<b>16. Amendment</b>
<br>
<br>

We reserve the right to change these Terms from time to time upon notice to you. If we make changes to these Terms, we will provide notice of such changes by posting the 
 revised Terms to the Services and updating the “Last Updated" date at the top of these Terms. In some cases, we may provide additional notice to you, such as via our Services or to 
 an email address associated with your Account. Your continued use of the Services following our provision of any such notice will confirm your acceptance of the revised Terms. If you do not agree 
to the modified Terms, you must stop using the Services.
<br>

<br>

<b>17. Miscellaneous</b>
<br>
<br>

These Terms constitutes the entire agreement between you and the Company relating to your access to and use of the Services. 
We may assign our rights and obligations under these Terms. Under no circumstances may you assign your rights and obligations under these Terms, including in the event of change of 
control or by operation of law, without our prior written consent. The failure of the Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. 
We will not be liable for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under these Terms where the delay or failure results from any cause beyond our reasonable control. Except as otherwise provided in herein, 
the agreement is intended solely for the benefit of the parties and are not intended to confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any other person or entity.
