<h1>THE LORDS PRAYER
<p>

<h2>
Our Father who art in heaven,
<p>
hallowed be thy name.
<p>
Thy kingdom come,
<p>
Thy will be done,
<p>
on earth, as it is in heaven.
<p>
Give us this day our daily bread,
<p>
and forgive us of our trespasses,
<p>
as we forgive those that trespass against us.
<p>
And lead us not into temptation,
<p>
but deliver us from evil.
<p>
For thine is the Kingdom and the Power, and The Glory Forever.
<p>
Amen
