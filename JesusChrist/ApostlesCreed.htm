<H2>The Apostles Creed</h2>
<h3>
<p>
I believe in God, the Father Almighty,
<p>
the Creator of heaven and earth,
<p>
and in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord;
<p>
Who was conceived by the Holy Spirit,
<p>
born of the Virgin Mary,
<p>
suffered under Pontius Pilate,
<p>
was crucified, died, and was buried.
<p>

He descended to the dead.
<p>
The third day he arose again from the dead.
<p>
He ascended into heaven
<p>
and sits at the right hand of God the Father Almighty,
<p>
whence he shall come to judge the living and the dead.
<p>
I believe in the Holy Spirit,
<p>
the holy universal Church,
<p>
the communion of saints,
<p>
the forgiveness of sins,
<p>
the resurrection of the body,
<p>
and the life everlasting.
<p>
Amen.
<p>
