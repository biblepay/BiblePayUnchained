<h1>The Nicene Creed</h1>
<p>

We believe in one God,
<p>

      the Father almighty,
      <p>

      maker of heaven and earth,
      <p>

      of all things visible and invisible.
      <p>

And in one Lord Jesus Christ,
<p>

      the only Son of God,
      <p>

      begotten from the Father before all ages,
      <p>

           God from God,
           <p>

           Light from Light,
           <p>

           true God from true God,
           <p>

      begotten, not made;
      <p>

      of the same essence as the Father.
      <p>

      Through him all things were made.
      <p>

      For us and for our salvation
      <p>

           he came down from heaven;
           <p>

           he became incarnate by the Holy Spirit and the virgin Mary,
           <p>

           and was made human.
           <p>

           He was crucified for us under Pontius Pilate;
           <p>

           he suffered and was buried.
           <p>

           The third day he rose again, according to the Scriptures.
           <p>

           He ascended to heaven
           <p>

           and is seated at the right hand of the Father.
           <p>

           He will come again with glory
           <p>

           to judge the living and the dead.
           <p>

           His kingdom will never end.
           <p>

And we believe in the Holy Spirit,
<p>

      the Lord, the giver of life.
      <p>

      He proceeds from the Father and the Son,
      <p>

      and with the Father and the Son is worshiped and glorified.
      <p>

      He spoke through the prophets.
      <p>

      We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic church.
      <p>

      We affirm one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.
      <p>

      We look forward to the resurrection of the dead,
      <p>

      and to life in the world to come. Amen.
      <p>
