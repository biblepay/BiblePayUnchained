<h2>BiblePay University</h2>
	
	<br />

    Welcome to BiblePay University. 
	<br />
	
	<p>
		We are proud to offer our FREE college level courses to the general public to help make disciples globally.  
		
		<p>

		We decided to start a satellite college of Harvestime.org, an academic publisher of gospel materials, who supplies many gospel based colleges internationally.  We are now an official institute for administering college courses and final exams (we paid for the course material, and paid to become an institute).  We are currently not involved in generating degrees, but our course will include partners that allow you to transfer your credits to accepting schools (since our material is harvestime material).  
			An example will be provided explaing how to transfer credits toward a Bachelor of Theology.  
			<p>

<br />

<b>What type of doctrine is this based on? </b> 100% is based on the Gospel of Jesus Christ, from a non-denominational perspective.  
				The material teaches a literal bible, without symbolism (for example, the book of Acts miracles are taught as literally occurring).  
				The version taught is from the KJV bible, with both the Old Testament and New Testament included.  
				(The course is written entirely in English, but will be available in more languages on high demand).  
				<br />

<p>
	Please follow these instructions to successfully learn our academic material and become a disciple of Jesus: 
	<br />

	<p>
		<small>
		Our program is broken up into 4 modules, with each module having approximately 4-6 courses.  
		Each course is equivalent to roughly 4 college level credits, taking approximately 3 months at one hour per college day * 2 days per week.  
		You may work at your own pace, and are encouraged to use an online bible for reference. 
	<p>
		How do I take the courses, and where do I find the material?  Please read the following expected workflow:  You will need to pick a few courses first.  For example, if you are getting started, you will want to start with module 1, and for example pick 3 courses:  Foundations of Faith, Bible Study Methods, and Old Testament survey for example.  
		These will be your three current classes.  You can take all 4 if you want. 
	<p>
		To Take each class, you will start by clicking on the Course Material link for Foundations of Faith.  The PDF links for the course material are below.  
		You can think of this as your class school book, in PDF format.  You will progress through this at your own pace as if attending a college course.  
		You will be responsible for writing your own writing assignments (given in the course) and keeping those on your PC.  
	<p>
		When you are ready for your final exam, you will click the Final Exam link next to Foundation of Faith.  This is our certification test interface.  
		We will allow you to use this interface as many times as necessary.  This interface supports Exam Testing Mode and Exam Review mode.  
		In review mode you will see all of the questions answers so you can go back and learn those subjects better in the course material and or online.
	<br />


		BiblePay will store your final exam score by your wallet CPK so that you can print out your grades.
